Marvel's Spider-Man is a 2018 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

 Based on the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man, it is inspired by the long-running comic book mythos, and adaptations in other media. In the main storyline, the super-human crime lord Mr. Negative orchestrates a plot to seize control of New York City's criminal underworld. With Mr. Negative threatening to release a deadly virus, Spider-Man must confront him and protect the city, while navigating the personal problems of his civilian persona, Peter Parker.
The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Spider-Man's traversal and combat abilities. Spider-Man can freely move around New York City, interacting with characters and undertaking missions, and unlocking new gadgets and suits by progressing through the main story or completing tasks. The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items. Combat focuses on chaining attacks together against numerous foes while avoiding damage, using the environment and webs to incapacitate foes.
